    <title>Product Introduction</title>

    <para>eformsign is an electronic document solution that allows anyone to
    easily create electronic documents from paper documents and utilize
    various data stored in electronic documents. You can easily create
    electronic documents by uploading your PDF files onto eformsign and
    converting the files to electronic forms via eformsign's Web Form Designer
    feature. You can also create electronic forms by using eformsign's add-in
    feature embedded in Microsoft Office (named <emphasis role="bold">Form
    builder</emphasis> or <emphasis role="bold">OZ in Office</emphasis>). The
    Form builder feature allows anyone who knows how to use the Microsoft
    Office Suite to easily convert existing documents to electronic
    forms.</para>

    <para>eformsign allows you to create a workflow for each template
    according to your company's business process. You can flexibly set a
    document signing process for internal documents requiring approvals as
    well as for external documents such as contracts, agreements, and
    applications. Furthermore, detailed configurations such as notifications
    and required input fields can be set for each workflow step or recipient,
    and the progress status of documents is logged as history. Moreover, an
    audit trail certificate is provided for the prevention of document forgery
    and falsification.</para>

    <para>eformsign also provides a bulk send feature, by which users can
    create and send multiple documents at once and can minimize repetitive
    input with auto-fill feature. Also, by adding and configuring custom
    fields, fields in documents such as company information, group and member
    information, recent input value, and date can be automatically filled in.
    Furthermore, eformsign allows users to easily manage companies' members
    and their permissions, configure detailed notifications settings for
    documents, and manage and utilize data entered in documents by extracting
    input data.</para>

    <para>The eformsign solution also provides a digital signature feature
    which allows you to sign e-signatures on electronic documents.</para>

    <para>A digital signature is a signature in electronic form that replaces
    the traditional wet-ink signature. Just as when signing a signature on
    paper, you need to prove that the signer is you and this is done by going
    through an identity verification step. Personal information such as email,
    social security number, password, phone number, certificate, etc. can be
    used to verify identity.</para>

    <para>Digital signatures have been legally binding in phases in the vast
    majority of countries around the world.</para>

    <para>eformsignâ€™s e-signatures are legally binding for
    individual-individual and corporation-individual matters. As well, it
    provides various additional features for non-repudiation.</para>

    <note>
      <para>The following describes the legal effect of digital signatures of
      some regions.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>South Korea: Digital signatures based on PKI standards have a
          strong legal status, and their legality is not discriminated against
          the wet-ink signatures. According to Section 3.3 of the Digital
          Signature Act, a digital signature other than a certified digital
          signature shall have such an effect of a signature, signature and
          seal, or name and seal, as is agreed between the parties
          concerned.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>USA: Under the "technologically neutral" principle, any
          preference to more sophisticated or more secure technologies such as
          PKI is not given. There are many cases of increasing the reliability
          of digital signatures through identity verification or
          authentication services.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>EU: Digital signatures are categorized into Qualified
          Electronic Signatures (QES), Advanced Electronic Signatures (AdES),
          and general Electronic signatures, and their legal status is applied
          accordingly, corresponding to the characteristics of each type of
          document.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Japan: With the existence of a Specified Authentication
          Services, a stronger legal effect is given to the digital signature
          authorized by the secretary of the state.</para>
